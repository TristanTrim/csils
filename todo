X checksum on root
X start csills cli with function
X rename parsetree elements
X tags should be set
X load/save parsetree with yaml! (remember to 'Loader=yaml.Loader', and import needed stuffs)
   X make name -> __name so it shows up first in yaml. yeah it's a kludge, but w/e
     `->  _aname, cause __name throws mysterious errors. I guess "__" is protected?
X tag menu e-every msg, u-unparsed msg, n-none
   X new -> add
- replyWith & replyTo lists
   - slave replyWith and master replyTo will be nonsense...?
- delete nodes
- abstract cursor including 'cur_ob' and such
- figure out what 'nodes;identities;bytes;brances;parts of parsetree' should actually be called...
- blink node in parseTree view on new termination there

- send msgs and 'catch' responses?
- msg parse based flow control?
- blink/flash in io
- join nodes
- show parsing in main log (optional?)
- config file yaml
- checksum as 'msg fin' check
- test for checksum longer than msg in display or elsewhere

- utf-8 can't decode arrow keys

- create 'default'/'demo' config
- "r+" doesn't read or create? I guess I could just try to read and if the files not there read nothing...
- add empty line at bottom of log for following new messages
- reconfigure display 'for loops' to be for n lines and use if & offsets within to print info

- tree sort by amount of terminations
- some error checking on checksum leng & etc
- use of globals should be use of common data object
- roll tags over to new line if too long... rather than cutting off.
- only update display on change
- dev1 & dev2 into 'parsetree' class
   - device class with name, connection details, and parsetree
- configuration of save filenames
- default "first_parse" tag set to "u" for purpose of filtering log
